# Travel App

A basic **Flutter app to track trips.**

<br>

It covers:<br>
✔️ State management with the **Riverpod** package.<br>
✔️ Clean Architecture by Domain-Driven Development (**DDD**).<br>
✔️ Local storage with the **Hive** package.

💡 This app was mostly built as part of the _Riverpod, Clean Architecture, Hive - Flutter Travel App_ [tutorial](https://youtu.be/fT-eOgl_jhk) by Flutter Guys YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@flutterguys).
